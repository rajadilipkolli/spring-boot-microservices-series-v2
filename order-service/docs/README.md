- **Performance Tests:** Load testing and benchmarking
- **Container Tests:** Testcontainers for realistic testing
- **Mocking:** Strategic mocking for unit tests

### Configuration Management
- **Properties:** Externalized configuration with validation

- **Health Checks:** Comprehensive health indicators

## 🔄 Sequence Diagram Mappings

Each documentation file includes detailed mappings between:
- **Mermaid sequence diagrams** showing the flow
- **Specific code files and line numbers** implementing each step
- **Configuration settings** affecting behavior
- **Error handling paths** and fallback mechanisms

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Performance Issues
1. **N+1 Query Problem** → ID-only pagination strategy
2. **Blocking Operations** → Async processing with CompletableFuture
3. **Memory Usage** → Streaming and batch processing
4. **Connection Pool Exhaustion** → Optimized pool configuration

### Reliability Issues
1. **Message Loss** → Exactly-once processing with Kafka Streams
2. **Partial Failures** → Saga pattern with compensation
3. **Service Unavailability** → Circuit breaker with fallback
4. **Resource Contention** → Bulkhead pattern for isolation

### Scalability Issues
1. **Database Bottlenecks** → Read replicas and caching
2. **Thread Pool Exhaustion** → Adaptive thread pool sizing
3. **Memory Leaks** → Proper resource management
4. **Queue Backlog** → Parallel processing and batching

## 📊 Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Throughput:** Orders processed per second
- **Latency:** P50, P95, P99 response times
- **Error Rate:** Failed requests percentage
- **Availability:** Service uptime percentage

### Business Metrics
- **Order Success Rate:** Successful order completion
- **Saga Completion Time:** End-to-end transaction duration
- **Retry Success Rate:** Background job effectiveness
- **Circuit Breaker Activations:** Resilience pattern usage

### Technical Metrics
- **Database Connection Pool Usage**
- **Kafka Producer/Consumer Lag**
- **Thread Pool Utilization**
- **Memory and CPU Usage**

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Service Layer:** Business logic and orchestration
- **Repository Layer:** Data access optimization
- **Configuration Layer:** External system integration
- **Web Layer:** API design and validation

### Best Practices
- **Event Contract:** Kafka type-info headers are disabled for DTO serialization. Consumers must explicitly type their payloads.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive exception management
- **Logging:** Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Testing:** Test pyramid with appropriate coverage
- **Documentation:** Living documentation with examples

### Performance Considerations
- **Database Queries:** Optimize for read/write patterns
- **Async Processing:** Non-blocking operations where possible
- **Caching Strategy:** Multi-level caching approach
- **Resource Management:** Proper cleanup and pooling

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Architectural Improvements
- **Event Sourcing:** Complete event-driven state management
- **CQRS:** Separate read/write models for optimization
- **Microservice Mesh:** Service-to-service communication
- **Reactive Streams:** Full reactive programming model

### Technology Upgrades
- **GraalVM Native Images:** Faster startup and lower memory
- **Project Loom:** Virtual threads for better concurrency
- **Kafka Streams DSL:** More expressive stream processing
- **Observability Stack:** Enhanced monitoring and tracing

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding, maintaining, and extending the Order Service microservice architecture.
